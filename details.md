## Design notes

This explorable aims to be playful and low stakes to explore. It is patterned after graph paper and uses primtive shapes to feel "mathy" while using bright colors, shadows, and animations to feel playful.

# Little Big Details

- The observer has an eye that animates
- When the observer is moving the animation stops
- The cursor on the observer changes to a pointer when hover and to a grabber when it's being moved

- In the editor interface the buttons increase in size slightly when hovered to make it clear they are clickable
- When clicking on a button the color changes to indicate its been clicked
